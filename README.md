One of the best ways to access to data is via an API, which makes your life easier. Not all API are free and require a paid subscription.
Understanding how to make calls to an API or connect an API to your app is a key skill to have, as it will make your life easier.

APIs normally have documentation ready for you to use which is essential. There's also python packages wich make this connection easier for you, but the key is that you can connect to API whatever way, with or without proper packages. 
In this project I used Spotipy to connect to Spotify API and request data to analyze an hypothesis. It was a seamingless process and the call for that was transformed into a dataframe to be able to work on it and analyze the data.
